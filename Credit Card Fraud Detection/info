The Dataset was taken from Kaggle.
Link to Dataset: 
The Credit Card Fraud Detection actually predicts the whether a transaction made over a credit card is fraud or not.
The data set is highly skewed, consisting of 492 frauds in a total of 284,807 observations.
This resulted in only 0.172% fraud cases. This skewed set is justified by the low number of fraudulent transactions.
The dataset consists of numerical values from the 28 ‘Principal Component Analysis (PCA)’ transformed features, namely V1 to V28.
Furthermore, there is no metadata about the original features provided, so pre-analysis or feature study could not be done.
The ‘Time’ and ‘Amount’ features are not transformed data.
There is no missing value in the dataset.

Experiment:- Dataset was Initially divided in the ratio 9:1 for training and testing.
  Then it was trained over different Classification Algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Trees and Random Forests.
  Each of the above model was then tested and the results were as follows.

Accuracy Scores
LR :  0.9992275552122467
KNN :  0.9993328885923949
SVM :  0.999385555282469
DecisionTrees :  0.9990871107053826
Random Forest :  0.9991222218320986

The best accuracy was given by SVM.
